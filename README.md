# SOC Fundamentals: Suspicious XLS File Analysis

**Platform:** LetsDefend.io  
**Case ID:** SOC138  
**Alert Type:** Detected Suspicious XLS File  

---

## üìù Summary
This exercise involved investigating an alert for a suspicious `.xls` file. The workflow simulated real SOC triage and analysis steps, including endpoint review, log analysis, malware validation, and incident response actions.  

Key outcome: I confirmed the file was malicious, identified C2 communication attempts, and applied the playbook response of quarantining the device and documenting findings.

## üîé Investigation Process

### Step 1: Alert Review
- Received alert for suspicious XLS file.  
- Opened case and reviewed alert details.  
- Investigated endpoint `172.16.17.56`.

### Step 2: Endpoint Analysis
- Observed suspicious process: `POwersheLL.exe`.  
- Terminal history showed directory commands followed by a PowerShell execution ~10 hours later.  
- Gathered **file hash** for deeper analysis.

### Step 3: Malware Verification
- Submitted file hash to **VirusTotal**.  
- Latest analysis (4 days ago) indicated the file contained a **malicious macro**.  
- Determined malicious connnections - searched in log managment.
- Confirmed C2 address accessed

![LogManagement](https://github.com/JustInCybersecurity/Suspicious-XLS-File-Analysis/blob/main/LogManagement%20C2.png?raw=true)

### Step 4: Log Analysis
- Queried endpoint logs in SIEM for host `172.16.17.56`.  
- Found 3 logs: 2 HTTPS and 1 HTTP request.  
- Port 80 traffic revealed destination IP `35.189.10.17`.  
- URL extracted and submitted to VirusTotal ‚Üí flagged as **malicious**.

### Step 5: Response Actions
- Applied playbook:
  - Quarantined affected endpoint.  
  - Confirmed malicious macro via VirusTotal.  
  - Verified outbound C2 accessed.
- Created analyst notes and closed the alert.
